Face recognition using dlib, face_recognition and OpenCV.

This face recognition system uses dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. 
dlib's model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark.
The model used here is a tweaked version of ResNet-34 having fewer layers and reduced filter size.
